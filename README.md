## 🧭 What is MemVault?

MemVault is a **local-first personal knowledge management system** built for developers, AI power-users, and anyone who works with large amounts of information daily and needs a **private, portable, and searchable place to store it all**.

Unlike cloud-based tools (Notion, Obsidian Sync, Roam), **MemVault runs entirely on your machine**. Your data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly export it. Sensitive information — API keys, passwords, user IDs, payment details — is stored with **military-grade AES-256-GCM encryption** and your master password is never written anywhere.

Think of it as your own **private second brain** that your AI assistant can read and write to, making every future interaction smarter and more context-aware.

## ✨ Features

### 📔 Knowledge Entry System

- **Daily Diary** — Write freeform personal notes with a clean, distraction-free editor
- **Conversation Logs** — Store AI conversation exports (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) for future reference
- **Work Logs** — Record development sessions, decisions, bugs fixed, and project progress
- **File Attachments** — Upload any file (up to 200MB) and attach it to an entry
- **Full-Text Search** — SQLite FTS5 full-text search across all 100k+ entries in milliseconds
- **Auto-Sync** — Pull all Antigravity AI conversation histories automatically

### 🔐 Encrypted Secure Vault

- **AES-256-GCM** encryption — the same standard used by banks and governments
- **6 secret categories**: API Keys, Passwords, User IDs, Payment Details, Phone Numbers, Custom
- **PBKDF2** key derivation (100,000 iterations) from your master password
- **Per-secret random IV** — even identical values produce different ciphertext
- **Master password never stored** — verified via encrypted sentinel pattern
- **Click-to-copy** — click any revealed field to copy to clipboard instantly
- **Session-scoped unlock** — re-lock with one click, or on page refresh

### 🌐 Browser Activity Sync

- **Chrome history** — automatically imports visited sites (deduped by URL + date)
- **Edge history** — cross-browser support
- **Bookmarks** — folder structure preserved as tags
- **Smart filtering** — skips `localhost`, `chrome://`, `about:`, and extension pages
- **Dry-run mode** — preview what would sync before committing

### 🎨 Modern Web UI

- **Dark + Light theme** — instant toggle, preference saved to localStorage
- **Inter + DM Mono** typography — clean, professional, readable
- **Responsive** — works on any screen size
- **Access Map** — built-in API documentation panel showing all endpoints live
- **Real-time stats** — live entry counts per category

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: AI Developer with Multiple Projects

**Problem**: You work with 10+ AI tools daily (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot). After a session, you close the tab and the context is gone. Next week when you're debugging the same issue, you start from scratch.

**Solution with MemVault**:

- Run `node sync-antigravity.mjs` — all 88+ past AI conversations are indexed in SQLite
- Search "React hydration bug" → instantly find the exact session where you fixed it 3 months ago
- AI reads your vault before answering → responses always build on your existing work

---

### Use Case 2: Freelancer Managing Multiple Client Credentials

**Problem**: You have 30+ client API keys, login credentials, and payment details scattered across sticky notes, emails, and text files. One data breach = catastrophe.

**Solution with MemVault**:

- Store every API key under `🔑 API Keys` → encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Passwords under `🔐 Passwords` with username, URL, and notes
- Payment info under `💳 Payment Details` → last 4 digits + expiry only
- Everything behind ONE master password that's never written down or stored
- Local-only → no cloud company can be breached to expose your data

---

### Use Case 3: Daily Journaling with Search

**Problem**: You journal daily in a notes app but searching old entries is slow, unreliable, or locked behind a subscription.

**Solution with MemVault**:

- Write directly in the web UI → `Save to Vault` stores entries in SQLite
- Search "feeling anxious about" → all relevant diary entries surfaced in milliseconds
- Export-friendly: all data is in a local SQLite file you can open with any DB browser

---

### Use Case 4: Knowledge Worker Building a Personal Wiki

**Problem**: You read dozens of articles and try tools weekly. Within 3 months you've forgotten 90% of what you learned.

**Solution with MemVault**:

- Browser sync captures every article you visited (Chrome/Edge history → vault)
- Add notes as diary entries with context on what you learned
- Search "kubernetes init containers" → find the article you read + your own notes on it
- Nothing is cloud-locked — your knowledge stays permanently accessible

---

### Use Case 5: Developer Tracking Progress

**Problem**: At stand-up, you struggle to remember what you did yesterday. Your PR history doesn't capture design decisions or dead-ends you explored.

**Solution with MemVault**:

- End each work session: write a brief worklog entry in the UI
- Sync your AI coding assistant conversations → context preserved
- Search by date or keyword to reconstruct any past work session
- Build a queryable history of every technical decision you've ever made

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows** with WSL2 (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Node.js 18+** in WSL
- Git

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrChartist/memvault.git
cd memvault
npm install
```

### 2. Set Vault Root (optional, defaults to `/mnt/d/AG/Vault`)

```bash
export VAULT_ROOT=/your/path/to/vault
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
# From WSL
node server.mjs

# From Windows PowerShell (runs hidden)
Start-Process wsl -ArgumentList "-d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -c `"cd /path/to/vault && node server.mjs`"" -WindowStyle Hidden
```

### 4. Open the UI

Navigate to **<http://127.0.0.1:7799>** in your browser.

### 5. First-time Secure Vault Setup

Click **🔒 Secure Vault** tab → enter any password → it becomes your master password permanently. **Write it down somewhere safe offline.** If lost, encrypted secrets cannot be recovered.

### 6. Sync Your Data

```bash
# Sync AI conversation histories (Antigravity)
node sync-antigravity.mjs

# Preview browser history (dry run)
node sync-browser.mjs --dry-run

# Live browser sync
node sync-browser.mjs
```

## 🔒 Security Model

### What is encrypted

Everything in the **Secure Vault** (API keys, passwords, user IDs, payment details, phone numbers, custom secrets) is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being stored in SQLite.

### Encryption chain

```
Your Master Password
       │
       ▼
PBKDF2(SHA-256, 100,000 iterations, static salt)
       │
       ▼
256-bit AES key (never stored, derived on-demand)
       │
       ▼  ┌─ 12-byte random IV (unique per secret)
AES-256-GCM
       │
       ▼
{ iv: "base64", authTag: "base64", ciphertext: "base64" }
       │
       ▼
Stored in SQLite secrets table
```

### What is NOT stored

- ❌ Your master password (never written anywhere)
- ❌ The derived AES key (computed fresh each request, discarded immediately)
- ❌ Plaintext versions of any secret

### What IS stored (safely)

- ✅ AES-256-GCM ciphertext (base64)
- ✅ Random IV per secret (base64)
- ✅ GCM authentication tag (prevents tampering)
- ✅ Secret labels (plaintext) — only the label, not the value

### Password verification mechanism

On first use, MemVault encrypts a known test value (`"memvault-ok"`) with your password and stores it as a special `__sentinel__` record. On subsequent unlocks, it attempts to decrypt this sentinel — a match confirms your password is correct without storing the password itself.

### What's excluded from GitHub (`.gitignore`)

- `db/` — your entire SQLite database (entries + encrypted secrets)
- `entries/`, `conversations/`, `worklogs/`, `files/` — all personal vault content
- `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `credentials.json` — any credential files
- `test-add.json`, `test-secrets.sh` — any test data with real credentials

> **⚠️ Important**: Never commit `db/index.sqlite`. It contains your encrypted secrets. Even though they're encrypted, exposing the ciphertext unnecessarily is bad practice.

---

## 📁 .gitignore Coverage

The following are always excluded from version control:

```gitignore
db/              # SQLite database (your data lives here)
*.sqlite         # Any SQLite files
entries/         # Diary entries
conversations/   # Conversation exports
worklogs/        # Work logs
files/           # File attachments
.env             # Environment variables / secrets
*.key, *.pem     # Cryptographic keys
credentials.json # Any credential files
```
